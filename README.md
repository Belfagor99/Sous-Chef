## Project specification
The project consists of an android native app written in Kotlin called Sous Chef. It is designed
to empower users in managing their kitchen ingredients with finesse. It goes beyond mere
ingredient tracking, offering users tailored recipe recommendations based on the contents of
their virtual pantry. Moreover, the app takes a proactive approach by providing timely notifications about impending ingredient expiration dates. The goal is to enhance
the culinary journey for users by facilitating optimal utilization of the ingredients at their disposal.
